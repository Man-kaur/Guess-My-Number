1.firstly query selector will select the element with class or id you provide as argument
2.Secondly, if you dont give text content console will print the whole element rather than the content present in that element
3.When multiple methods are given using dot operator, execution is from left to right
4.to select css property use document.querySelector('.class').style.property = 'valueWithUnits';


-->DOM Manipulation:  Javascript will interact with the browser(Docuement Object Model)
                    Structured representation of html docs, allows js to access html elements and styles to manipulate them
                    do see the DOM tree structure: Document is the entry nd html is root element in this tree
                    DOM is not part of js, it is part of web API, it helps js to interact with browser
-->API : Application Programming Interface --> it is responsible for fetching data from internet and providing it to browser or app to display
        Eg: Web application --> user ask for weather of NY , API will fetch the data from the provider which could be weather channel and then 
        provides this data to apps

--> EventListener: a method in DOM called to provide an event(clicks) with some functionlity(event handlers)
                    eg: document.querySelector('.guess').addEventListener('event',function(){});
--> eventHandler: method which is called whenever event mentioned in addEventListener takes place(handled by js engine)

--> Never violate the DRY principle: Refactor your code(identify the duplicate code and eliminate it)
    Used in guess my number game via making display message fxn instead of doing same thing again and again





ABOUT GAME:
1. for generating random number, Math.random()*num is used. (num defines the range);
2. this random function will give decimals, so Math.trunc is used.  --> final code is: Math.trunc(Math.random)*num +1;
